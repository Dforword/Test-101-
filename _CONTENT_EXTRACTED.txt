Purpose & Goals
Objective: 
The site should demonstrate that Ragu is the most credible partner for leaders who want AI that works in the real world, the way they need it to. It needs to build brand awareness, establish trust, and explain our approach with clarity and restraint. It must showcase our consulting, our platform and our custom agents without overwhelming users with technical detail. The site should present case studies and thought leadership that reinforce our expertise and signal that we understand high-touch, high-context businesses. ( This content should be written and designed for social platforms like linkedIN). Finally, the site should support demand generation by making it easy for qualified visitors (prospective clients or potential partners) to understand our value, share information about us with their peers, request a conversation or connect with us about a partnership. In short: 
Build brand awareness and credibility
Showcase products, services
Showcase case studies and thought leadership
Generate leads
Share information
Target audience: 
The primary audience is senior leaders at high-touch businesses where judgment, nuance and service define the brand. This includes CEOs, COOs, CTOs and heads of client-facing functions in luxury goods, travel, wine and spirits, private wealth, professional services and other high-context sectors. 
The secondary audience is strategic partners, such as system integrators and boutique consultancies, who may want to bring Ragu’s platform or expertise into their client base. The site should speak to both groups with confidence, maturity and clarity.
Core messaging:
Ragu helps organizations adopt AI with purpose and precision. We bring strategic clarity to what matters most, align leadership on the right starting point, and deliver a secure AI foundation that employees can use immediately. Every solution reflects the client’s brand, workflows and standards, so it works in practice, not just in theory. Our agents elevate service, unlock efficiency and create new value, and they scale through a governed, adaptable platform. What should come through above all is that Ragu blends trusted advisory experience with technical excellence to help leaders move from uncertainty and experimentation to systems that deliver lasting impact.
Viewer pain points and mindset:
Leaders at high-touch, high-context businesses know they need to adopt AI, but  are unsure where to begin and what real value looks like. They’re cautious about making the wrong investment, disrupting service (or their employees) or introducing tools that feel disconnected from their brand. Many have tried (or are tempted to try) small pilots or point solutions that produce little impact, create new silos and/or never reach production. T
They seek clarity on when to act, how to sequence the work and what to expect in terms of cost, effort and return. They want partners who understand their business, their standards, and the risks of moving too quickly or without a plan. Detailed case studies will prove very useful to them.
Ragu’s approach is designed for this mindset. We remove ambiguity by helping leaders identify meaningful opportunities, define a credible starting point, and build an integrated AI foundation that avoids the pitfalls of pilot paralysis and bolt-on tools. Instead of fragmented experiments, they get a path that produces early wins while setting the conditions for long-term, compounding value.

About us
Mission We help organizations adopt AI that works—systems built for how their business actually operates, not how vendors imagine it should.
Our story
Ragu was founded over three years ago, when generative AI was emerging and enterprises were either on the sidelines or testing fragmented experiments. We saw something different: an opportunity to bring strategic discipline to AI adoption, pairing advisory experience with hands-on technical delivery.
We started as a platform company building unique,custom AI assistants tapping our cutting. We evolved into something more useful—strategic advisors who also build. Today, we work with clients who share our belief that AI should elevate service, not erode it. While we are industry agnostic, our clients are hyperfocused on high touch and luxury businesses. Engagements span luxury travel, fine wine and spirits, technical, financial, manufacturing and other sectors where judgment and nuance define the brand.
In 2025, our work with Black Tomato won "Best Use of AI" at the TTG Luxury Travel Awards—recognition that AI, done well, can enhance rather than diminish what makes a business exceptional.
What guides us
People first, always AI should make work better for the people who do it and the clients they serve. We design for adoption, not just deployment.
Craft over speed We'd rather build one thing that lasts than ten things that don't. Every agent, every integration, every recommendation reflects that standard.
Clarity before action The hardest part of AI isn't the technology—it's knowing where to begin. We help leaders see the path before they commit to it.
