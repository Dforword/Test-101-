VibeCoded Website Brief
1/8/26
This brief is the single source of truth for building the Ragu.ai website using an AI-first, vibe-coding approach. The site should be generated primarily through natural-language intent, not manual UI tooling or platform-specific workflows.
All output must adhere strictly to the attached Ragu Brand Identity Guidelines (2025)

.
Purpose
The website must establish Ragu AI as the most credible partner for leaders who want AI that works in real, high-context organizations. The site should prioritize trust, clarity and judgment over scale, speed or hype.
Audience
Primary audience
Senior leaders (CEO, COO, CTO and heads of client-facing functions) in high-touch, high-context businesses, including luxury goods, travel, wine and spirits, private wealth and professional services.
Secondary audience
Strategic partners, including system integrators and boutique consultancies.
Audience mindset
They are cautious, skeptical of AI theater and concerned about brand risk, service disruption and wasted investment. They want clarity on where to begin, how to sequence work and how AI systems will function in practice.

Vibe-coding iteration rules
Iteration feedback should be expressed in terms of feel and intent, for example:
“Too sales-driven”
“Feels like SaaS”
“Needs more restraint”
“Undermines credibility”
“Too clever, not clear”
Avoid pixel-level or tool-specific feedback.
Definition of done
The site is complete when:
It communicates credibility immediately
It feels calm, confident and intentional
It supports publishing and measurement
It does not feel overbuilt or performative
